verble
======

During my time in Venice I set out to build an algorithm to conjugate verbs in Italian. The result was actually just a series of dictionary literals wrapped in a CLI that I used to study for class.

If you're reading this, know that this repository contains nothing computationally interesting, merely the musings of an overcaffeinated, inexperienced nerd.

However, fiddling with this is how I learned python and became excited about computational linguistics.

I also didn't learn Italian that well but hey, _c'est la vie_.
